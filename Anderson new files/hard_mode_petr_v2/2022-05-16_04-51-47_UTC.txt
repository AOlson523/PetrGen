Unknown Petr from Kingdom Hearts 1 Final Mix! During my childhood, I was looking at kingdom hearts gameplay on YouTube back when there was a dislike counter for comments, and I found this raw footage of the secret boss from KH1FM! He looked so awesome to me, and he’s still one of my favorite secret bosses ever lol. I think I hyped him up too much, but it’ll be the 1st drop during Fall 2022
