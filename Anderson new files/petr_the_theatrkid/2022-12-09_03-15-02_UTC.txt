The Schuylr Petrs! ⭐️ I got excited so I decided to post these now :) The women that carry the show (which as they should, they’re amazing). Angelica (pink dress) is the oldest and I wish they kept her song “Congratulations” in the show because it’s so good (listen to it fr). Eliza (green dress) is the middle sister and sings one of my favorite songs in the show (makes me cry every time, you know the one 🥲). Peggy (yellow dress) is the youngest and tends to be forgotten, but then you remember her as soon as you see the actress in the red dress (iykyk). Hope you guys like this design! 🥰
