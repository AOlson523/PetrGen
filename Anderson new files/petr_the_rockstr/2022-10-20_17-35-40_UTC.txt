That which might hurt you, so try and be cool."

I'm really proud of this one. This is it y'all. We peaked at petreezer.

One of my favorite bands, ever. Rivers Cuomo ironically and unironically has my heart. Ya girl loves power chords.

I only printed ~150 of these, so I'll be handing them out randomly in small amounts. I'll have some this Friday at my drop. First few people to tell me their favorite song/album get one! (Mix it up, everyone likes island in the sun!!)

Hope you're doing good beebs. Please make sure to be safe at the drops and follow all the rules. I want to keep doing this as long as possible, but only while it's safe and promotes love in the community.

Rock on!
