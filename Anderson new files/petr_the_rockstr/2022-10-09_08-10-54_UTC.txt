"A smile from a veil? Do you think you can tell?"
Wish you were here (1975)

Hi everyone. It's late, but sometimes the artistic inspiration hits you hard. 

Pink Floyd reminds me of my childhood. I find their sound comforting.

I listened to all of animals, wish you were here and part of the wall while making this. I didn't feel the time pass, which is whats so amazing about art.

I need to go to bed. Good night loves it
