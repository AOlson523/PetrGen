"We are a home for all students, a collaborative space for innovative solutions, and an advocate for social justice and equity."

@ucifresh x rockstr present ZotBites Petr! For those of you that don't know zotbites is a free service that allows for students to receive a text message whenever there is leftover food from special events on campus. ZotBites is an amazing idea, and has provided an alternative to throwing good food away. Also, visit the Fresh Basic Needs hub located near Mesa Court for free essentials like produce, shelf stable foods and toiletries. These services are available for UCI students to use! Come out to the ZotBites event on Monday 11/7! I'll be dropping 350 Petrs at the event. See you there!
