"Getcho mans, if you switchin' up then tell me in advance (Yeah, ayy)"

This one was really fun to draw, and I was listening to Brightside the whole time. I wanted to showcase an Asian artist for AAPI heritage month. I was just about to draw Warren Hue too, maybe in the future. Aside from that, hope y'all passed your midterms ðŸ¥²

Remember to share! I'll do a Q & A at 500 follows ðŸ‘€

Btw, I read and take into consideration each of y'alls feedback. If there's an artist that you're really excited about, please share! I love to hear it.

Psst.... Drop soon ðŸ¤«
