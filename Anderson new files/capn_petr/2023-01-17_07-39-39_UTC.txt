#1: Hello everyone! I am pleased to announce that I will be dropping Cynthia, alongside the amazing designs of my fellow Petrs that are also Pokémon Fanatics, this Friday! Feel free to swipe through post and take a look at the designs that will be dropping, and of course, please read and acknowledge the rules as well.

My challenge regarding Holo Cynthia remains. More info on my slide about it! But basically, be the first person to beat a fellow challenger, then beat me, to get the big holo Cynthia, and be ready for a chance to win a special, special prize. You can still challenge me for a medium holo Cynthia if you win! 

Hope to see you there! Hope you manage to catch ‘em all!
