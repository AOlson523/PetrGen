hello fellow anteaters, this post is to mark the end of lucky petr. i'm so sorry if revealing and dropping a petr during finals week hindered your studying in any way. i hope that i was at least able to pass some luck on to y'all for your finals. i'm sure it was a rough week for most but alas we've made it though. it's honestly been a pretty rough quarter, for some reason winter quarter has historically been the worst every year. in the end however, we overcome it and have a well deserved break waiting for us. it's a pretty short one but it's so necessary to take a step back from our fast paced lives and breathe for a second. we're constantly bombarded with a stream of pressure and expectations during school to the near brink of insanity at times. i hope that all of you have a serene and relaxing spring break. try to take your mind off of school and grades, curves will be fat don't worry. i'm very excited to see y'all soon afterwards. whether it's your first spring quarter or your last, it's a truly a wonderful time of year. the skies will be clearer and flowers will bloom brighter. there's a lot to look forward to, also big things in regards to petrs are soon to come :) #petr
