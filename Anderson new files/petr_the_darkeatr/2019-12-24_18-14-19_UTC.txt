Above we have the drop schedule for Winter 2020. Let’s start off the new quarter with new stickers! But also with the return of stickers from last quarter! 
I’ll be dropping one old sticker alongside a new one, but you can only choose one at a time. I want to provide something fresh for long time followers but also something for new followers who missed out last quarter. For those wondering about the mystery March drop, it will be a special design that I never posted before! 
I’m forever grateful for the massive support from all of you these past 6 months. I wouldn’t have imagined making it to 1500+ followers, and it’s amazing how big the Hub account has become. I’m ready to keep doing drops along with my fellow Petr distributers :)
