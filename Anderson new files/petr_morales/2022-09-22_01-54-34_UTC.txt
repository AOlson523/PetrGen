welcome to a new year!
the weather is too hot for me to wear my suit so until then, i’m going to be hiding my stickers around campus for y’all to find :)

among the pool of stickers i have, there will be only 25 of this new design. i’ll be dropping hints on my story after planting each batch of stickers. happy hunting!
