"I must correct you... as you are sorely mistaken. We are not witches... but followers of science!"
It's Medusa, Marina, and Molly! They're the three Sea Witches from Omori, and one of them will be dropped alongside each Omori boss I drop as the special version, with Medusa being dropped first alongside Space Ex-Boyfriend! Since they're pretty different from the main design I'll be dropping, whenever you get one of these three you'll also get the common variant of the main design being dropped! It's a two-for-one special!
