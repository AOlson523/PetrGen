YALL?! I know this is a fanpage but…HEAR ME OUT…BUBBLE BUDDY PETR! Did I just do something? Is there a Spongebob theme petr out there already?Was this done already? HAS NO ONE DONE THIS BEFORE?! I AM FREAKING OUT BECAUSE IT LOOKS SO GOOD! This idea came to my head and I immediately dropped everything (sorry bio homework) to draw it. If someone can make this a sticker…I SWEAR I WILL LOVE YOU FOREVER.

Also don’t judge the throne…it was copied and pasted from Google lol. I will draw a better throne eventually.
