While I’ve had a major setback followed by my withdrawal from the Abnormal Pack Drop, I’m officially announcing a theme change for this account
I’m going to try and stick to the original theme of 80s themed Petrs I had in mind when I made this account, starting with these two 80’s Petrs
I hope y’all like ‘em
