“You sit on a throne of lies.”

Capn 1 here! Disregarding the misleading quote, I spent an embarrassing amount of time preparing this special Buddy Petr from the movie “Elf”! This movie is an absolute classic, and drawing this Petr gave me a trip down memory lane. 

The reason I made this? I’m going to be hosting a Toy Drive, inspired by yours truly @petr_the_rockstr , in hopes of giving kids in need the beautiful feeling of getting gifts during Christmas. There will be more details to be announced, but it looks like it would take place on Friday, December 2nd, at 3:00 PM (subject to change, but unlikely).

The plan is that everyone can come get one, regardless of donating toys or not, but there will be MORE PETRS joining me in this mission to bring kids joy this Christmas! Stay tuned for upcoming designs 👀 

I’m excited to present to you, Capn Petr’s (hopefully successful) Toy Drive 2022!
