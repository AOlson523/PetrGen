[THE SURPRISE AT THE END]

Dear UCI,

It has been a great honor serving as your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. This past year has been really fun for me and seeing everyone’s smile when they receive a sticker has been very rewarding to me. With the school year coming to an end, other things do have to end. When I was invited to this massive collaborative Petr drop, I thought “This is the best way to go out on a high note.” Hundreds of you received copies of my (and my great artist of a little sister’s) work and left happy. Many of you asked for pictures together and that made me happy! (btw don’t forget to dm me pics if we took any c: )

Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man,

Petr Morales

Swipe to the end for the surprise :)

P.S. If you haven’t gotten it yet, this post is a joke I’m not retiring
