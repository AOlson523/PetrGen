Happy New Year Petrphiles! Here is a preview of our first drop ever! Due to classes being online for the first 2 weeks, I will announce an update of the drop most likely at the end of the 2nd week of the quarter so everyone can return to campus for a fair shot at getting this Petr! Feel free to share with your friends!
