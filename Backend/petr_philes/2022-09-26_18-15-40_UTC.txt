Petr the Minion
â€¢
Hi all I know Iâ€™ve been absent for some time and not discussed any drops upcoming soon. Unfortunately my schedule has been very busy. I have loved every minute of being a Petr and giving out stickers to the UCI community! However, I think itâ€™s time for my retirement. SIKE I LIED! PetrPhiles is back and ready for Year 2 at UCI! I have a drop this upcoming Thursday, 2:10 PM with fun details in the story post!! Canâ€™t wait to see yâ€™all zotthots this year and remember, when you feel like youâ€™re alone.. there is always a PetrPhiliac in each and every single one of youâ€¦.. MWHAAHAHAHA ðŸ˜ˆ
