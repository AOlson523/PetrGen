UNDIE RUN 2022 ANNOUNCEMENT
Hello! You may have noticed a few of these posters around campus. Well guess what! I am bringing back the UndieRun ðŸ©² with @petr_the_impostr ! We hope to see you all there, invite your friends and share these instructions!

Instructions:

When?: Friday, June 3rd @ 9:00 PM (WEEK 10)
Everyone will begin to gather until we are ready to run around Outer Ring. Projected to start at 9:30, The Undie Run will finish at the Infinity Fountain. 

Where?: Flagpoles! (The stairs)

More Details:
Wear clothes that you would like to DONATE which we will collect in bins/bags and bring to local donation centers! For lack of better terminology, participants will strip and prepare to run in their undies (suits allowed). We will have a separate bin/bags for those who want to recollect their clothes at the end of the run.

@petr.morales and I have pitched in to bring 400 GLOW-STICKS for participants to wear as necklaces, bracelets, etc. Everyone who donates clothes will have priority to the glow-sticks! Please be environmentally friendly and keep them on the entire time, dispose of afterward, and/or pick up glow-sticks you use to make it easier for clean up crew. 

Participants are not required to be in their underwear: Short-shorts, crop-tops, running shorts, tank-tops, compression shorts, gym wear. These are all valid. We hope to breed a welcoming community and allow people to feel comfortable in whatever form this may take.

Participants are free to join and leave whenever they please:
Everyone is welcome to simply come and get a sticker when the location is released or fully participate in the event for its entire duration.

Please share and get your friends to come out and celebrate the school year and donate some clothes!

This post will be updated as we collaborate with other associations and organizations who are willing to help us run this.

Thank you all!
