Should I be studying rn? Yes...
Does my brain hurt from studying the brain also yes.

This petr goes out to all the holiday/retail workers. The crowds, disrespect, and the endless holiday music just hits different. Fun fact my work schedule scheduled me over 20 hours this week when I told them not to. Lmao so yall PLEASE respect retail workers we don't have time or the mental stability during the holidays.

Also this now makes my second time using procreate I feel like a child pressing random buttons
