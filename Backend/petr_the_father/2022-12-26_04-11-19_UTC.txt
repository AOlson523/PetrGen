Ok so Hanukkah is coming to a close. I am not Jewish and don't Celebrate personally but I still felt there was a lack of petrs for the holiday. Here is my potato latkes petr in honor. 

For those that don't know it is common to eat oily foods during Hanukkah (from what I have learned). I personally wanted to make a design to honor the holiday that looked delicious.

To any zotties that celebrate I hope you had 8 nights of fun.
