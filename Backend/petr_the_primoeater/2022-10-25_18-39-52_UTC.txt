Hi Petr Collectors! 

I am announcing my retirement as Petr the Primoeater.

There’s been a lot weighing on me lately and when I realized that being a Petr was contributing to most of my stress in the background, I decided that for my own good, I should stop being a Petr. 
This quarter was the primary source of that stress due to a lot of different reasons, like the safety hazard Petr drops are becoming and feeling like I was on my own little island instead of in a community. I concluded that I’m too timid to make the best out of being a Petr. 

Maybe if things calm down or maybe if I start being bolder, I’ll come back. As of now, I don’t see myself coming back soon.

Thank you to everyone who provided me support through this journey and those who loved my designs. You’ve made being a Petr worth it. ❤️
