"Tatakae! Tatakae!"

Eren Jaeger is here in his Survey Corps outfit!!!! 😁 

I'm quite pleased with how this turned out; his poofy hair was a bit of a struggle 😆

Be sure to check out my Mikasa, Armin, and Hobo Eren designs too!!! 🥰

P.S. All 4 will be an upcoming drop to celebrate Season 4 Part 3 😉
