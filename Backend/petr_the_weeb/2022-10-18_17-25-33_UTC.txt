Guts from Berserk! 🗡

I colored him differently from my usual method because I think he looks cooler this way. I loveeee drawing characters with with lots of details it’s honestly so fun to translate them into Petr form 😩 I’m also happy to announce that Guts will be my first drop this quarter!! Hope y’all like him :)) 

(Also thanks for the love on my last post I was overwhelmed by ur kindness 🥹🫶🏻) I hope everyone has a great great day!!
