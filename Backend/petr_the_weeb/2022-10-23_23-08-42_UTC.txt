Tomie!!! One of my favorite stories by Junji Ito, specifically the Painter chapter. I could really feel the frustration of trying to capture her which was pretty ironic lol. I accidentally spent a whole night making this cuz I really wanted to mimic the panels I got this from! Hope y’all like it 🥹

This was a collaborative post that I made with @petrpoopr!! They also made a Junji Ito inspired Petr that y’all should definitely check out!! 

As always, take care and have a great rest of your Sunday!! 🫶🏻
