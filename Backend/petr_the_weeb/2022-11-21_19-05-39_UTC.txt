Hey y’all! Super excited to announce that my Miku Drop will take place Thursday 12/1 at 4pm!! Not only that, but I will be dropping a holographic Sakura Miku sticker! 

There are two ways to get her, one: be one of the first 15 people in line or two: come to the drop in Miku merch and I’ll give you one! This can be anything from a t-shirt, plushie, accessories, figures, anything that has Hatsune Miku on it. Just point out what merch you have (I can’t see that well in my mask) and I’ll hand you a sticker. I wanted to make the holographic more accessible so bring your Miku merch!! 

Let me know if there are any questions! Can’t wait to see y’all 🫶🏻💖 Remember to take care!!
