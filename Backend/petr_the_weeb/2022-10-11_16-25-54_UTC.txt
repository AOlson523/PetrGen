Jolyne Kujo! 

Hey y’all! Took a break but we’re back in business. I’ve been reluctant to cover any jjba characters because @petr_the_joestr already had such amazing designs and I don’t like the idea of making a sticker that’s already been done. They were actually the account that inspired me to start making petrs! I’ll never forget their kindness and this sticker is like a tribute to them. This will be the only jjba character I do and I hope y’all enjoy! 

It’s been pretty rough recently but then I remembered how fun it is to make Petr stickers so I’ll be posting more frequently. As we roll into the new quarter, remember to check on yourself mentally and physically. Reach out if you need help and remember to drink water! Pls take care y’all :))
