Hello all! The new Petr generation has inspired me to do one last drop. I’ll be giving out many of my old designs at Reddit Rock (near BC’s Cavern, check the second slide). 

Please make an organized line at the location, no running or cutting. There will be HUNDREDS of stickers, each person will get 2 random stickers. I’ll also be handing out a special design for early birds. 

Please join me and other anteaters on January 27! :)
