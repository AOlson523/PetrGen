*beeping noises*
It's Cube from LiveALive! I just finished this game recently and I knew I had to make this little lad as he is absolutely adorable. This also marks the start of a new thing that I'll be doing from this quarter onwards in which I'll occasionally make a smaller, single panel post in-between larger ones. This is mainly because triple designs take longer and require the right character (enough source material/enthusiasm) so sometimes a single panel post just works out better. Expect a good number of these this quarter, as I'm going to be very busy, although I do have some larger posts planned (with one hopefully being posted this weekend).
