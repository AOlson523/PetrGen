hello fellow anteaters, this post is to mark the end of the spooky petrs. they've had a good run but the time for their relevance is now over. the ending of a seasonal variant however eneues the beginning of another. expect a process akin to the reveal of the spooky petrs in the next few coming weeks, more relevant information will be posted via the story later on. again i'd like to thank all of you for the support, appreciation, and many renditions of petr. it really means a lot :) #petr
