hello fellow anteaters, this post is in regards to a couple of things. for one it is to mark the end of thankful petrs. i didn't stick them around campus as much because i wanted to focus on giving them out to all of you. i'm still so sorry if i wasn't able to get thankful petrs to some people but there were at least more overall petrs given directly to everyone. don't worry though as the advent of the next petr nears upon each passing day. the other part of this post, in the spirit of thanksgiving, is to acknowledge my appreciation for all of you. it is the time of year where it is trendy to be thankful for what you have and i'm so grateful for each and every one of you who has supported me up until this point. i can't even begin to express my gratitude, you have all made this fraction of the journey more rewarding than i could have ever imagined. it only makes me all the more galvenized for everything else i have coming for you all in the near and distant future. i hope everyone has a wonderful thanksgiving spent in the company of family and/or friends as well as a stress free little break before we begin to near finals season. i'll see you all next week :) #petr
