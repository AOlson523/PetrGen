hello fellow anteaters, this post is to mark the end of march madness petr. this petr came and went with record speed. i wanted to honour and commemorate the historical run that the uci men’s basketball team had this season. you guys went off in the big west tournament, busted tons of brackets first round against kanas, and battled in our first ever second round against oregon. never before have i felt such passion and unity from the student body for a school sporting event. you guys collectively established a new and lasting presence of culture for uci athletics. i’m grateful to the whole team and can’t wait to see us go even further next year. sorry if this post was a little off track petr wise but petr is uci culture, as is uci men's basketball. i hope that combining the two further strengthens the future of uci culture all the more. thanks @ucimbb, we're all still very hungry. i'll see y'all sooner than usual :) #petr
