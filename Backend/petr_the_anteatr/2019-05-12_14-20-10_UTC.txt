hello fellow anteaters, this post is to mark the end of don't talk to me or my petrs ever again. i really didn't expect to be releasing petrs with the frequency i have been as of late but likewise i never expected the proliferation of petr to be so vehement. i feel as though i've been getting a tad bit loquacious with some of these posts so i'll attempt in abating this one. today is mother's day, and while it can be said that "every day is X day," i'm not giving today more puissance just merely speaking on it. first and foremost it's important to be mindful of those who may not have their mothers around for whatever reason. a mom isn't necessarily just the person who gave birth to us, there can be people in our lives who exemplify maternal qualities and earn an honourable title as such. regardless of your situation, take a moment today to let your mother/motherly figure know that you love and cherish them, as you should every other day of the year. our moms work so hard, are very patient with us, teach us all kinds of things, make so many sacrifices, literally give us life- so don't forget to do something for them every once and a while. come to think of it, uci is kind of like my mom. this place took really good care of me and contributed to making me the person i am today, so all this petr stuff is sort of my way of saying thanks i guess. sorry random closing thought idk. anyways i love y'all and i'll see everyone again next time :) #petr
