hello fellow anteaters, this post is to mark the end of thanos petr. i'm sorry that this post is longer than endgame, at least that thematically aligns it a tad bit more though. things have been pretty crazy as of late, sometimes i wish i could gather the infinity stones and snap everything back to simpler times. this release was a little rough around the edges in regards to its arrival, distribution, and departure. i said it before and i want to say it again, there are a lot of y'all as of current. whilst i'm working tirelessly to match the growth of petr, the degree of difficulty in managing everything ascends as i feel as though the interest is increasing at a rate faster than that of which i'm able to keep up with. i'm just one person so i'm only capable of so much. with large numbers comes large responsibilities and i very much feel liable for whatever happens in regards to petr, during and outside of drops. [i will be commenting the remainder of this post as i have far exceeded the character limit]
