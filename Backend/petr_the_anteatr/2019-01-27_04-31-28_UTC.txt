hello fellow anteaters, this post is to mark the end of new year new petr. for some reason this petr felt especially short lived. alas like the rest of them, it has come and gone gracefully. this is an interesting time of year. most commonly regarded as a time for new beginnings and fresh starts; that often ends up not being the case for most of us. it matters not though because in an environment such as ours, we can usher in change whenever we want. petr was a resolution for me at the beginning of the school year. i honestly wasn't sure if petr was going to make it out of 2018, but thanks to all of you it did so with flying colours. as i stand before 2019, i look forward with bleary but optomistic eyes. i hope to constantly be improving on petr in any way i'm capable. i hope to bring more petrs. i hope to bring more riddles. i hope to bring more joy. fall quarter was more amazing than i ever could have imagined thanks to you all and i'm certain that winter quarter will only be better. i'm never able find ways to articulate how much i appreciate all of you for supporting me up until this point. you're all as much a part of petr as i am. take care for now, i'll see y'all next month :) #petr
