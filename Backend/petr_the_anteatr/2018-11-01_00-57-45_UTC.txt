hello fellow anteaters. this post is here for those, now or in the future, who may want to inform themselves more on what exactly 'petr' is. petr (pronounced /ˈpēd•ər/) is an interpretation of the school mascot of the university of california at irvine and belongs to the student body. the idea of petr was conceived with the notion of bringing a little something more to the culture at uci. petr first started appearing on campus around september 24th 2018; stuck on walls, windows, doors, etc. the design you see here is the original petr, that being said there are many other seasonal designs of petr ready and on the way. all of you are also very welcome to designing petrs of your own, using mine as a base or making an entire rendition of your own. that about sums up all of the very general information regarding petr. the rest is really open to interpretation by the people of uci. again thank you to everyone who has shown support and appreciation up until this point, petr would not exist without you all :) #petr
