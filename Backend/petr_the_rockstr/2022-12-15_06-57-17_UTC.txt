"I want it to be like, messy!"

Redraw of the crowd favorite emo pop car queen! One of my favorite albums, this was the first post (ever) to break the 100 likes, including my personal account. I had to draw her two ways, with her sassy crossed arms and in her pinked up bug off to break ur heart ðŸ’”
Other slides: first rendition and art improvement from April, a shrunk Petr, some fan art, and highlights from the last drop i was at. Thanks for being so awesome y'all. Happy break!

*Note on recent events
Seeing as there was a terrible tragedy at UCI yesterday, the Petr community has responded by sharing mental health resources and a warm hug for anyone struggling with mental illness. Please reach out to a professional to get help if you need it. UCI provides various resources via @ucicounselingct You are not alone in this battle. We love you and want to see all zotties safe and healthy. Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays and rock on!
