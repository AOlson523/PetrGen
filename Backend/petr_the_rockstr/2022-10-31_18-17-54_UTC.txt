"i drove the whole time, but that's okay I'll just avoid the holes so you sleep fine. I'm driving here I sit, cursing my government for not using my taxes to fill holes with more cement!"

TÃ¸p Petr! Blurryface was a formative album and they are very special to my heart. I identify with their music and what they stand for, so ofc I had to make them into Petrs.. presenting, Josh Dunnr and Tylrr Josephr! What's your favorite song? Stay alive frens |-/
