"Hold it, focus, hoping, take me back to the light"

Harrr Stylr [extended cut]

Wanted to refine the original Harry since he won the poll. I'm really happy with it even though it took a while, and my wifi was acting up. Thanks for the support y'all and 300+ followers! Super excited for this drop and to share Harry Petr with this amazing community!

Anyone else excited for 5/20?

Keep up the good work, I'm proud of you! ‚≠ê
