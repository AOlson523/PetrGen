"We will no longer allow the government to oppress disabled individuals. We want the law enforced! We want no more segregation! We will accept no more discussions of segregation... And I would appreciate it if you would stop nodding your head in agreement when I don't think you have any idea what we're talking about!"
-Judith Heuuman 

Hi everyone! Here is the first disabled Petr, representing all my dsc kiddos and disabled individuals everywhere. The fought for disability rights is a complex one, but one of my favorites activists is Judith Heuuman. I highly recommend you watch her Ted talk, watch Crip Camp on Netflix or just learn about her because she is an amazing woman and definitely my inspiration. In honor of that, I've made my accomodations form available to all on the discord. A special thanks to @petr_the_kid for helping me out with the wheelchair.

Rock on!

With love, 
Rockstr

** I would also like to highlight all the Petrs who have used the accessibility form template I created and have helped in making all their wonderful designs accessable for those of us who can't run in the traditional manner. Thank you for validating our experiences and bringing attention to the reality of living in an ableist culture. I know that the process is more time and effort than a normal drop, but your alliance with the disabled community at UCI means the world to me <3
