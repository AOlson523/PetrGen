"I've gotta feeling... That tonight's gonna be a good night!"

Thanks to all my fellow Petrs, friends of Petr, line monitors and students for helping us pull off these incredible events. I'm exhausted, and a little sad it's over. I'm so glad I got to see everyone come together for an event run purely by students - no funding, no budget, just pure love and community. For my graduating seniors, even though I only knew you for a bit, I appreciate you and am looking forward to seeing where you go from here! ZOT ZOT ZOT
