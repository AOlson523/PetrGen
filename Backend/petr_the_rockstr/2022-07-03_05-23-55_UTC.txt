"Baked with REAL fruit!"

In honor of the movie screening happening on campus and me having to hike around the set to get to UTC, I present Pop-Tartr Petr! The goated sugary breakfast that literally nobody has time to heat up! Here's to my man Jerry Seinfeld, this movie better be hella good!

Side note i saw maverick today and it was literally the best movie I've seen a while. Tom cruise is just ðŸ˜©ðŸ’¯

Hope y'all are having a good summer! It's been kinda lonely NGL, lurking in the science library gets kinda sad. Hope to see y'all soon!
