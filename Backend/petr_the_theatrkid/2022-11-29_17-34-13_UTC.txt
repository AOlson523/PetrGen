Aaron Burrtr! ⭐️ Honestly, I want to play him so badly. Anyway, my second Hamilpetr design! Known as “the damn fool that shot him”, Burr is basically the opposite of Hamilton’s character, which makes them have some very interesting interactions.😅 In the musical, he also serves as the narrator and he has some AMAZING songs. Hope you all enjoy! 🥰
