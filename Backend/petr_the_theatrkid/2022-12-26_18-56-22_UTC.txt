“Floating, falling, sweet intoxication. Touch me, trust me, savor each sensation. Let the dream begin, let your darker side give in to the power of the music of the night.”

The Phantm of the Opera! 🎭 Probably considered the most classic show in all of broadway history, Phantom of the Opera features some of the most well known broadway tracks, such as The Phantom of the Opera, Think of Me and Music of the Night. It takes some serious skill to be in this show, just listen to the end of the song The Phantom of the Opera, the high note is INSANE (an E6 for all of my music people out there). Anyway, hope you all enjoy this design! 🥰
