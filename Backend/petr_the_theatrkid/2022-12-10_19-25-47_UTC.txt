“And when push comes to shove, I will send a fully armed battalion to remind you of my love!”

Is that a BONUS HAMILPETR DESIGN?! That’s right, King George III! 👑 Definitely the funniest character in the show even though he only has 3 songs. However he does make a surprise appearance during “The Reynolds Pamphlet” in Act II and once you notice him, the scene that’s supposed to be serious becomes really funny 😭 Anyways, I posted this bonus design in honor of the end of finals! Hope you guys enjoy it! 🥰
