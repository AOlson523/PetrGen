Since everyone is making pokemon petrs here is my personal favorite pokemon Chewtle.

Okay so with finals starting today I decided to design my own petr. That's right my father didn't make this one. I haven't done any art since May but I was inspired to give chewtle his petr debut. I hope yall like it.
