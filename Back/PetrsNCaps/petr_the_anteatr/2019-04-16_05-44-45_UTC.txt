hello fellow anteaters, this post is to mark the end of beach bum petr. akin to it's predecessor, this petr came and went in one fell sweep. i wanted to make a petr that abstractly represents themes present during the spring time. winter had an exorbitant presence this year but it's finally over and the sun shines bright again. we may now freely bask in the daylight and feel the crisp breeze of fresh air. for some this may be your first spring quarter, others it may be your last; regardless, we can all come together and enjoy the splendour of this beauteous time of year. spring is a time when i feel as though change is fostered on a very large scale. i don't know what it is but modish thoughts and possibilities manifest themselves within our minds and lead us to outcomes we wouldn't normally expect. i hope that whatever change you might undergo around this time is all for the betterment of yourself. take care and enjoy the rest of the week, i'll see y'all soon :) #petr
