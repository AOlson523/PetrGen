hello fellow anteaters, this post is to mark the end of romantic petr. i'm very much glad i was able to employ riddles upon its release, and i intend on doing so when the next petr is nigh. definitely the fastest petr to have came and gone, fleeting like love itself. valentines day truly capitalizes on the duality of romance. for some it may be a time to savour in their flourishing love, others might view it as a time of scornful reflection. regardless of whether or not you have someone to share affection with, at the very least you'll always have yourself. i'm going to stop talking on this now because i'm really not one for consistently insightful knowledge. i do however have one closing thought that i would like to share. i love petr and i love all of you. y'all bring so much positive energy into my life through your love for this little sticker. i appreciate each and every one of you and very much feel all of your appreciation as well. i live to see smiles at petr drops or renditions of petr or even just memes related to petr, it literally means so much. this reciprocative endearment makes me so happy to be apart of this whole thing. i constantly wish i could be doing more for petr but i do have my limitations. just know that i'm genuinely doing everything i'm capable of to make petr better in every way possible. thank you everyone for an amazing valentine's day <3 catch y'all next month :) #petr
