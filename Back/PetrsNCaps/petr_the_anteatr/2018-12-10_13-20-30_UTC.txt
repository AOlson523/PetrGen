hello fellow anteaters, this post is to mark the end of jolly petrs. the petrs had a great run this season; but as always, they must inevitably come to a halt. as the sun sets on the petrs, it dawns on finals week. for some it's the first and for others it might be the last, regardless this can be a very difficult time. i hope my distributing of petrs may have brought forth some levity upon the many weights of stress from finals. i wish you all nothing but the best of luck going into the week. there's a lot to look forward to on the horizon with break, holidays, a new year, and more petrs all steadily approaching. i hope the promise in the future is also able to strengthen your ability to make it through. lastly i'd like to once again thank each and every one of you for the strength you've all given to me. i don't know how but you all continue to blow my mind with massive amounts of love and support. y'all have made petr's run in 2018 more wonderful and worth it than i was every capable of imagining and i cannot wait for what's in store come 2019. until then enjoy break and stay warm in the winters, i'll see y'all next year :) #petr
