Here is an epic opportunity to earn a holo hollowed horn of salvation Ichigo from bleach! Complete one of the following quests to earn one:

Send an audio recording of a parent or guardian passionately saying bankai into their phone and i have to sense their spiritual pressure
• the community will vote on what is the best (dont vote for urself bc i can see the votes)
• Deadline for submission for this will be Tuesday 11:59 pm

Eat a slice of bread that was submerged into water and provide video proof (basically an empty sandwich with water as sauce)
• First person to send proof of this will receive it

Type up a 300-350 word essay MLA format and double spacing on why (insert name) is your favorite bleach character
• I will be checking for plagiarism on the internet so make it original!
• My consulting group and I will be personally rating the essays  because I doubt the community will want to rate multiple 300-350 word essays
• Deadline for this will be Tuesday 11:59 pm 

Create a soul reaper outfit at home with any articles of clothing and send me a picture of you in it; please don’t go out of your way to BUY anything expensive or anything at all, use what you have at home!
• bonus points if you have weapons for your bankai (stay safe) (if you have none make one :) (origami))
• the community will vote on what is the best (again don’t vote for yourself)
• Deadline for this will be Tuesday 11:59 pm

IMPORTANT: If you are not the first one to complete the water bread challenge, then feel free to do one of the other three challenges. You may not do multiple other than this exception for the water bread. If you have any questions please don’t hesitate to reach out! Good luck n have fun :)
