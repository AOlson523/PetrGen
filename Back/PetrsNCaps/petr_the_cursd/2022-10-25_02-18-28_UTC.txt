slendr petr

rules:
1. we will be hiding the petr papers taped around campus at an unannounced date and time. if you get a petr paper, bring it to our drops and you’ll get a slendr petr sticker
2. the papers will be unique (we’ll have something written on each of them to prevent photo copying)
3. they will be in extremely low quantity (around 10-15) so good luck
