“That’s what I’m workin’ on. A song to fix what’s wrong. Take what’s broken, make it whole. A song so beautiful it brings the world back into tune, back into time, and all the flowers will bloom.”

Orpheus Petr! 🥀 Hadestown is one of my favorite shows, and a core memory I have was freaking out with my best friend during “Wait For Me” because we performed that song together in our musical theatre club (I was actually Orpheus in our performance 😆). This musical is based off of a Greek tragedy, and the vibe of this musical is so cool. Fun fact- unlike most musicals, where the band is in the pit, the band actually performs onstage and it almost feels like they’re a part of the cast, which is awesome. Hope you all enjoy this design! 🥰
