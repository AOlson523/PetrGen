“She’s all of this mixed up and baked in a beautiful pie. She is gone but she used to be mine.”

Jenna from Waitress! 🥧 My favorite musical of all time! 😆 I saw this show in New York on Broadway and it is truly incredible. You’ll laugh and cry, and the songs are so catchy. Fun fact- during the show, an actual pie is made in the theater so the audience can smell pie as if they’re actually in the diner! 😋 Hope you all enjoy this design! 🥰
