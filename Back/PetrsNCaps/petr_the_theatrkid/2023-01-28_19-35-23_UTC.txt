Jack and Katherine from Newsies! 🗞️ I love this musical very much. Full of memorable songs and characters! Very fun couple dynamic of “daughter of rich father” and “guy rebelling against’s the rich father’s company”. 😂 Anyway, if you want some songs to pump you up and get you motivated, listen to this soundtrack. Hope you all enjoy this design and “seize the day”! 😉🥰
