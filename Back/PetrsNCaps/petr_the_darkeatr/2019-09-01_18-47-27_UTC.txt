Above is the game plan for Fall 2019. BatPetr, DeadPetr, and SuperPetr will return for people who were not on campus this summer. I will be doing rare drops where I’ll pick a design and drop only a small quantity of it since there are too many released designs for me to do big drops for. I threw in a secret drop for fun suspense :D

Thank you for the support this past summer! I wouldn’t have imagined to get this far with 20+ drops and 500+ followers all in 3 months. It’s been great doing this, and I hope to keep it up this school year alongside the other awesome Petr distributers :)
