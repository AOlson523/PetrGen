Probably the last video I’ll make 🤔 unsure lol but here’s the last Petr I dropped for Fall 2022! Pre-timeskip Luffy clone Petr (Amazon Lily/Impel Down clothing + charging gomu gomu no rifle) I removed the sock parts above his sandals in the final version, dw. It’ll be 12.15”x2.57.” Since this is just a clone, the real version is called Joyboy and will be 80”x60” (blanket).
