Harrr Stylr - Harry's House version

Hi zotties! It's so hot I hope y'all are staying cool somehow. Here's one I've been waiting to post ever since I saw how popular fine line era harrr was. What's your favorite song from the album?

As always, feel free to dm me any suggestions, send music recommendations or chat :) 
 
Looking forward to being back on campus with this lovely community ðŸ’ž
