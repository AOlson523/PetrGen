"We could leave the Christmas lights up till January."

Helloooo beautiful people! Hope week 4 is treating you okay! Stem majors, hang in there!! Here's a cute design i will be dropping this Friday! We got some holos, some huge ones and some littles! Check out @petr_the_readr and @petr_the_mouseketr for the rest of the designs.

Also thank you to all the lovely people who bring me little gifts! It really makes my day that someone appreciates this chaotic mess of a person dressing up in a wig and tutu to play music and hand out doodles on paper. You make this community what it is. Thank you for the light âœ¨

What's ur fav song from the album?
