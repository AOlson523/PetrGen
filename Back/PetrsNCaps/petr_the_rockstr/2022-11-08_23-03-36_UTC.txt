"Gobble Zot!"

Hi! Join us for a canned food drive and drop soon! Wednesday 11/16 at 3:30. Follow @petr_the_fixatr for their first ever drop. Bring a can, get a sticker. Bring 3+ cans and get a raffle ticket for a chance to win prizes (Slide 6)!! Thanks to @petr_the_procrastinatr for designing the adorable thank you cards! Also, bring a handwritten note with a positive message. These will be used in a future event!! 
*EDIT* Mistake on Flyers:
All goods will be donated to UCI Fresh Basic Needs. Flyers have errors on them. We apologize for any confusion.

Let's make this happen y'all! I believe in you and the potential to haul in all those cans and help feed your fellow ANTEATRS!
