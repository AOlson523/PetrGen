"RAWRRRRRRRR" -PETRSAUR

"Zut?! Zut!? Zut!!" UCU anteatr

1: here's the second drawing i will be dropping at the Friday spooky drop! Lovely Mr. Petrsaur!! I only have a few, so run fast! 

2: As some of you have noticed, my costume has a UCU shirt. I had this custom printed and drew a anteatr smirking in honor of the hilarious Costco misprint. Unfortunately, i can't mass produce or sell these stickers because of ✨ copyright ✨ but @tapucosmo printed out some tiny ones to give out as prizes!

3. Thank you to all the lovely line monitrs! Y'all are super chill and I'm glad i got to meet you!

You can get one by:
-winning a game i play with the crowd (rock, paper scissors, guess that song or whatever else i come up with)

-as a thank you if you bring me candy/gift/donations

-randomly! These probably won't be a "drop" but if you see me around and interact with me during Petr events, I'll usually have some!

UCU ANTEATRS GO ZUT!? ZUT?! ZUT!!
