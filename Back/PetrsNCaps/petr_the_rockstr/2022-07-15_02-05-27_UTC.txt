"But it's been no bed of roses, no pleasure cruise. I consider it a challenge before the human race and I ain't gonna lose!"

[Remastered 2022] Freddr Mercur!! 
I absolutely love Queen and this was the character that inspired me to start this account. I'll hopefully be dropping this one fall quarter to celebrate the new school year. I was *this* close to making Rogerina, maybe next time. Been super busy this summer but also missing my friends and Petr drops. Side note, watching the videos of Live-Aid makes me wish I was born in the 80s. Maybe one day I'll attend a concert like that ðŸ¤ž

Stay healthy babes!
