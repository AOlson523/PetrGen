Sister Cindy comes to UCI and itâ€™s time to Be A Ho No Mo! Unreleased Petr concept idea, for all those who donâ€™t know: Sister Cindy sighted today outside Langson Library by the flagpoles! (we do not have a stance on her platform, just made this concept idea for the meme)

Thank you to everyone who came out to the Petr Nguyn drop yesterday! The turn out was much bigger than I thought so I shall begin ordering more stickers ðŸ˜­ Congratulations to all those who received a Cha gift card ðŸ§‹
