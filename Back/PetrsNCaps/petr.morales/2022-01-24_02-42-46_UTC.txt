Two years ago, I had plans to join in on the sticker game as another Spider-Man. It was unfortunate that I have been forced to postpone these plans, but now that we are going back in-person soon, I can finally resume my plans to do drops!

My mentor, @beter_borker, has retired and has given me permission to carry on his legacy by dropping his previous stickers. I will drop a good amount of each of these for those who have not had the opportunity to get them before. In the meantime, I will also be working on new Petr designs. If anyone would like to collaborate with me on these new designs I would greatly appreciate the help. 

I will see you all in February for my first drop!

-Your new Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man
