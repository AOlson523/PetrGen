Thanks for coming out to the Undie Run! Even though I could not see out of my mask lenses I could tell that y’all had a lot of fun and I’m happy that we got to do something nice!

I’m sorry I didn’t get a chance to offload the remainder of my stickers. I started giving out some but it got too messy with 2-3 lines forming and wanted to wait until the next few locations to drop more. I’ll maybe put together a small something to let y’all have a chance to get some!
