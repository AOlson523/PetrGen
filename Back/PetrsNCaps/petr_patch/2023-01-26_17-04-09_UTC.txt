“Yeah, this is big brain time.”

Heyo! I planned my next solo drop to be Markipetr, and I figured what better way to represent Mark than to make it a charity drop! 

So next Thursday, February 2nd @ 4:00 PM, be sure to come grab a Markipetr because for each sticker I give out, I will match and donate $1 to a charity that will be decided by the community! 

I have 250 Markipetrs just waiting to be given out, so make me go broke 🫡

More news to come so be sure to stay tuned!
