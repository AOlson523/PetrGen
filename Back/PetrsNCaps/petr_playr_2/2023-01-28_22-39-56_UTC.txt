"OHOHOHOHOHOHO!!"
It's Sweetheart from Omori! Sorry it's been a while since I posted, this quarter has been rough and it's been hard finding time to make Petrs, but I really like how this one came out!! Look on the second panel for a sweet jelly-filled donut surprise! (I made it because I don't think I'll ever get over how she's literally a donut LOL)
