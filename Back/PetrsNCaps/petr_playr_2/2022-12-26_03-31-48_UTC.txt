"I love you... and all you guys!"
It's the photo from the end of Xenoblade 3! This photo concludes Rexmas, which was an absolute(ly exhausting) blast to do. This photo killed me the first time I saw it, especially in the context of what Rex says in Xenoblade 2 (quoted above), so I knew I needed to do something special involving it. Anyways, I'm very happy to see this completed, and I hope you all enjoy it!!
