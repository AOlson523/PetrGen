"I'm not a cat."
It's Niko! They're a nonbinary cat-person from a slightly lesser-known indie title called OneShot! I know I said I would be doing some Omori bosses (and I still will soon), but I wanted to make this as a little treat to myself since my birthday is tomorrow and OneShot is one of my favorite games (plus it honestly doesn't get enough love).
