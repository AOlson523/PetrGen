Thanks so much to everyone in the Petr community for making this past quarter so eventful!! You all have honestly been so supportive and encouraging, and I can't wait to show you some of what we've been cooking for this quarter!! Additionally, thanks to @petr_indieatr for coming up with this idea, it's a really cool way to share everything from the last quarter and I hope more Petrs join in!!
