When I first decided I wanted to make Petrs, I was a bit wary because I’m not the most natural artist, especially with digital art - but I found that the process is actually really fun! 

For anyone considering becoming a Petr but maybe a little unsure of where to start, I encourage you to just give it a try! The best part about using apps like Ibis Paint X (which is what I use) is that it’s pretty easy to come back and tweak things a bit until you’re happy with it :) if anyone curious to learn more about the process or if you have any questions/requests for me, my DM’s are always open
