When driving me to school one day, my father gave me one of his usual car lectures. I usually ignore him and just zone out to my music, but what stood out to me this time was when he started talking about Spider-Man. He didn’t approve of such vigilantism, said that “With great ability comes great accountability.”

It reminded me a lot of what my Uncle Aaron used to say. “You’re either a smart fella, or a fart smella.”
